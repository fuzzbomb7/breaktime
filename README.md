# Break Time!
A Windows desktop time tracking app for Freshbooks.

I wanted a time tracker that was better than the javascript app offered by Freshbooks. I wanted to be able to add or subtract time, or round to the nearest 5 minute interval. I wanted to be able to enter time in minutes, not fractions of an hour. I wanted an app that would pause the timer if I had to step away from the desk. Most importantly, I wanted it to be free. So I made it myself.

Break Time! offers much of the same functionality as the premium offerings featured on Freshbooks' website. But because I didn't have a fancy website, or a program with an attractive GUI, Freshbooks wasn't interested. (They still have that damn Vista Time Tracker widget on their site though!)

## Setup and Usage

To set up Break Time!, click the *Preferences* icon and enter the first part of your Freshbooks URL, as well as your API key. You can also adjust preferences, such as Windows startup, popup reminders, and pause when idle.

Click the *Refresh* button to retrieve your current Freshbooks projects. You can filter projects by client, or simply select your project from the list.  Be sure to select a task as well.

Click the *Start* button to start the timer. The *Clear* button resets the timer to zero. If you want to manually edit the time, click the padlock icon to unlock the timer for editing. You can edit the hour, minute, or the fractional hour value.

Use the *Add* buttons on the toolbar to easily add or subtract the specified interval from the timer, or the *Round* buttons to round the time to the nearest specified interval.

Once you're ready to log your time, enter a note (optional) and click the *Submit* button to log your time in Freshbooks!
